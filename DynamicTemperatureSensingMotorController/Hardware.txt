Project Hardware Requirements & Recommendations
-----------------------------------------------

• STM32 Nucleo Board (Recommended: STM32F401RE)
• Solderless Breadboard (Full-size preferred)
• Jumper Wires (Male-Male and Male-Female)

Sensors:
• Temperature Sensor (Recommended: LM35 or TMP36 for simple analog ADC use)

Motor System:
• L298N Dual H-Bridge Motor Driver
• 5V DC Motor (Small hobby motor)

Basic I/O:
• LEDs (5mm assorted colors)
• Push Buttons (Tactile switches)
• Resistors:
    - 220Ω (LED current limiting)
    - 1kΩ (general purpose)
    - 10kΩ (pull-up / pull-down resistors)

Power:
• 9V Battery with clip (For motor driver only)
• USB cable (For STM32 programming and logic power)

Important Notes:
• Do NOT power STM32 directly from 9V.
• Ensure all grounds (STM32, L298N, sensors) are connected together.
• Use USB power for STM32 logic and external supply for motor.
